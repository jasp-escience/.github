## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We'll use this repository for:

- Contributing to the [JASP statistics project](https://github.com/jasp-stats) via forks.

In the future, we'll probably use it too for:

- Keeping private, relevant only for the eScience members, information.
- Hosting a projects board.
- Managing issues.
